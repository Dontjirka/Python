#Python

1. I would recommend you to get VSCode, it's a GNU software. Or you can also you other IDEs for Python like PyCharm.

2. Once you installed VSCode you would need to install Python extension. (Also I would recommend you to download Prettier, as the name suggest, your code will look more pretty. Default shorcut is CRTL + SHIFT + I or you can just right click somewhere in your code a click "Format Document")

3. Once you downloaded your Python extension, you can start programming.

#Bonus
It's just optional but you can also download Bootstrap extension if you want to work with webs via Python
